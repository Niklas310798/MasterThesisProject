Warning: you requested the nanomsg event logger, but bmv2 was compiled without -DBMELOG, and the event logger cannot be activated
You disabled logging macros when building this binary; however, the log level is currenty set to include 'debug' and possibly 'trace' messages; therefore the logs will be missing most messages
